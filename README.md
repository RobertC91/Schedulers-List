# Schedulers-List

## Description

Right here is a work day scheduler to help you manage your daily routine. It's coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you view the site you will notice it is a list of rows with time slots for the average work day. The time slots change color based on the time of day, your current time slot will show up as a light blue, while the past time slots will appear as grey and the future ones green. There is an active time and date located at the top of the page just under the main heading.

Here is a link to the deployed site on GitHub:

As well as an image showcasing the Start Screen of the page:

## Installation

There are no installation requirements for this application.

## Usage

Click on the desired timeslot you wish to update, then type what you want to record in that timeslot. Click the blue save button on the right to record your data using your local memory. To remove items from the list simply highlight and delete them and then click the save button again to update the new time slot. I will look into adding a clear button in the future for convenience.
